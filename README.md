# svStyle SystemVerilog Formatter
A port to SystemVerilog by updating pre-existed repository https://github.com/thomasrussellmurphy/svStyle-verilog-formatter

All option is the same, please go to above site for more detail about argument option. 

Should work also with Verilog source file as long as SystemVerilog keywords is not used. This is just a copy of iStyle-verilog-formatter with updating keywords list.

Example on my recommended arguments which use GNU style and 2-space tab setting: 

`$ svStyle fileNeedFormat.sv --style=gnu -s2`

Bug report: https://github.com/khangp0000/svStyle-SystemVerilog-Formatter/

**This was a fork I made when I did not know how to make a fork.**
